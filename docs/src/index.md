## Documentation sections
To get started, look at the [Tutorial](@ref tutorial_langmuir), which includes step-by-step
instructions for running your first simulation using `ParticleInCell`. After
that, you may want to browse the [Example Gallery](@ref), to see other problems
that this package can be used to solve. The [Plasma Simulation Theory](@ref)
section contains information about the art of computational plasma physics, and
the numerical constraints that require the specialized tools developed here.
Finally, the [Manual](@ref) contains detailed information about the
entire public interface of the package.
