There are three different numbering systems that can refer to a location in the simulation domain:\n\nThe 'physical coordinates' of a point are the real (dimensionalful) coordinates associated with that point. This value can range from the lower bounds to the upper bounds of the simulation. This value will typically take the form Vector{T} or NTuple{N, T} where T <: Real.\nThe 'cell coordinates' of a point is the non-dimensional location of the point in units of cell lengths. This value can range from 0 to num_cells - 1, or outside this range if guard cells are included. The value will typically have the type NTuple{N, Int}.\nThe 'cell index' of a point is the CartesianIndex that can be used to index into field arrays at that point. This value must strictly be confined to axes(field.values), which, for any given dimension, will typically range from 1 to numcells + 2*numguard_cells + 1.\n\nThe first two types of indexing, physcoords and cellcoords, are independent of the number of guard cells in a given field, and depend only on grid quantities. Thus utilities for converting between these systems require only a reference to a grid object. On the other hand, the utilities for cell_index are specific the field being used, and thus those must be provided an AbstractField to do the coordinate conversion.\n\nIn general, physical coordinates are useful when considering the location of a particle, while the cell index is used to interpolate to and from the particle locations. The cell coordinates are useful for some interpolation algorithms, especially those that are defined for non-uniform grids.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"manual/#ParticleInCell2.UniformCartesianGrid","page":"Manual","title":"ParticleInCell2.UniformCartesianGrid","text":"UniformCartesianGrid(lower_bounds, upper_bounds, num_cells, periodic)\n\nThe simplest grid type, which represents a set of equally spaced rectangular cells.

The method is frequently referred to by the shorthand accelerate-rotate-accelerate because the acceleration from the electric field is split in half, and applied before and after the magnetic field rotation.\n\nAn applied magnetic field forces charged particles to travel in circular orbits perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, a simulation using the Boris method only makes sense when there are at least two velocity components, and in this case, the applied magnetic field must be strictly perpendicular to the velocity components. So for example, one could have a 1d2v simulation with a spatial grid along the x-axis, and velocity components in the x and y directions. In this case, the magnetic field would be forced to point along the z axis. If all three velocity components are included in the simulation, then the magnetic field can point in any direction.\n\nFor more details on the method, see Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Birdsall and Langdon, or the Boris' original conference proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"manual/#Misc","page":"Manual","title":"Misc","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/","page":"Manual","title":"Manual","text":"ParticleInCell2.compute_knots\nParticleInCell2.compute_bspline_coeffs","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/#ParticleInCell2.compute_knots","page":"Manual","title":"ParticleInCell2.compute_knots","text":"compute_knots(degree)\n\nReturns a vector of the knot locations for a polynomial b-spline with degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"manual/#ParticleInCell2.compute_bspline_coeffs","page":"Manual","title":"ParticleInCell2.compute_bspline_coeffs","text":"compute_bspline_coeffs(degree, [T])\n\nReturns a vector of vectors of the coefficients for the b-spline with polynomial degree, and unit-spaced knots, centered at zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron/","page":"Beam-cyclotron instability","title":"Beam-cyclotron instability","text":"EditURL = \"/home/runner/work/ParticleInCell2.jl/ParticleInCell2.jl/examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron.jl\"","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron/#Beam-cyclotron-instability","page":"Beam-cyclotron instability","title":"Beam-cyclotron instability","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron/","page":"Beam-cyclotron instability","title":"Beam-cyclotron instability","text":"(Image: Source code) (Image: notebook)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron/","page":"Beam-cyclotron instability","title":"Beam-cyclotron instability","text":"Coming soon...","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron/","page":"Beam-cyclotron instability","title":"Beam-cyclotron instability","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/beam_cyclotron/","page":"Beam-cyclotron instability","title":"Beam-cyclotron instability","text":"This page was generated using DemoCards.jl and Literate.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/two_stream/","page":"Two-stream instability","title":"Two-stream instability","text":"EditURL = \"/home/runner/work/ParticleInCell2.jl/ParticleInCell2.jl/examples/electrostatic/two_stream.jl\"","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/two_stream/#Two-stream-instability","page":"Two-stream instability","title":"Two-stream instability","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/two_stream/","page":"Two-stream instability","title":"Two-stream instability","text":"(Image: Source code) (Image: notebook)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/two_stream/","page":"Two-stream instability","title":"Two-stream instability","text":"Coming soon...","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/two_stream/","page":"Two-stream instability","title":"Two-stream instability","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/electrostatic/two_stream/","page":"Two-stream instability","title":"Two-stream instability","text":"This page was generated using DemoCards.jl and Literate.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/intro_to_pic/#Introduction-to-particle-in-cell-simulation","page":"PIC simulation","title":"Introduction to particle-in-cell simulation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/intro_to_pic/","page":"PIC simulation","title":"PIC simulation","text":"Classical plasma physics considers the motion of charged particles. The dynamics of these particles will be effected by the presence of externally imposed electric and magnetic fields, which is relatively easy to model since the motion of each particle is independent. However, the particles will themselves source an electric field–-and, if they are moving fast enough, a magnetic field–-due to their charge. The dynamics of other particles will be influenced by these 'self-consistent' fields, which corresponding source fields of their own. Thus, the dynamics of all of the particles is coupled, and so their equations of motion must be solve together. For a typical plasma, the resulting differential equations cannot be solved analytically, and the number of degrees of freedom means that direct computational integration of the equations is also impossible. Thus, plasma physics relies on various simplifications and assumptions to create reduced models that can be solved–- either exactly, or approximately.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/intro_to_pic/#Approximations-to-the-true-particle-distribution-function","page":"PIC simulation","title":"Approximations to the true particle distribution function","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/intro_to_pic/","page":"PIC simulation","title":"PIC simulation","text":"It is convenient to represent the locations and momenta of the particles using the distribution function","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/intro_to_pic/","page":"PIC simulation","title":"PIC simulation","text":"f(xpt) = sum_i=1^N delta(x - x_i(t)) delta(p - p_i(t))","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/intro_to_pic/","page":"PIC simulation","title":"PIC simulation","text":"where N is the total number of particles.

However, this also means that I am willing to entertain radical suggestions to improve the functionality of the package. If you are interested in using ParticleInCell2 for your plasma research, and you find that it does not meet you needs, please reach out on either GitHub, or over email, so that we can discuss how the package can be modified to suite your needs.\n\nGetting Started\n\nParticleInCell2 is currently not registered in the Julia package registry. Thus, to install this package, you should use Pkg.develop:\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.develop(url=\"https://github.com/adamslc/ParticleInCell2.jl\")\n\nDocumentation\n\nYou can view the latest documentation here.\n\nGoals\n\nFast: aim to have core time of less than 1 microsecond per particle per step without collisions.\nFlexible: it should be possible to implement essentially any kinetic plasma simulation in ParticleInCell2.jl. For common types of simulations, this might mean just piecing together components that are already included. More esoteric problems might require writing custom types that implement the desired algorithms. The advantage of writing this package in Julia is that these custom types will be just as performant as native components that are included in the package.\nScalable: the eventual goal is to enable scaling across an essentially unlimited number of cores using Julia's native multithreading for parallelization on a single node, and MPI.jl for communication across nodes. The goal is to support two different modes of parallelization:\nEach core is responsible for a single rectangular subdomain. The domain assigned to an entire node is also rectangular, which imposes constraints on how the node domain can be subdivided into subdomains for each core. Load balancing is achieved by varying the relative sizes of the domains such that each core has a similar amount of work per step.\nThe simulation domain is subdivided into subdomains called 'patches', and every node is assigned a list of patches that it is responsible for updating. The cores on each node work collaboratively on the list, each choosing one patch to work on, and then selecting another when they are finished. Load balancing is achieved by swapping patches between nodes to balance the workload while also seeking to minimize communication time by keeping the surface area of each node's responsibilities minimized. In order for this scheme to effectively load balance, it must be the case that the total number of patches is larger (ideally much larger) that the total number of cores.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Documentation-sections","page":"Introduction","title":"Documentation sections","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"To get started, look at the Tutorial, which includes step-by-step instructions for running your first simulation using ParticleInCell2.
